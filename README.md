# React Query

GoIT course homework: an extended React assignment based on the previous movie
search app. This project continues the work from the
[previous version](https://github.com/Aida-Zborovska/03-react-movies), adding
pagination and improving state management.

The app uses React Paginate for result pagination and TanStack Query to store
API responses and manage request state. The data is still loaded from the
external API: [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). .

The previous codebase was refactored to integrate these libraries and improve
data handling and scalability.

The UI styles were prebuilt; my responsibility was to implement the application
logic.
