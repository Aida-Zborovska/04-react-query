# React Query

GoIT course homework: a practical React assignment focused on form, modal window
and REST API.

The app lets users search for movies by keyword and displays results from an
external API [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). It
demonstrates working with controlled form, modal window, and a few supporting
libraries.

The UI styles were prebuilt; my responsibility was to implement the application
logic.
